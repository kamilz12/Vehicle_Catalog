# Vehicle_Catalog
Vehicle Catalog is a catalog of cars and motocycles. It's allow us to add new vehicles and show information about them. It was based on OOP paradigms with using polymporhism and inheritance in C++ programming language.
We can add to our catalog brand, model, year of production, count of wheels and much more things for indivudal type of our vehicle. At the moment, there are plans to create a GUI and add the ability to delete, edit, save and read information from the file.
